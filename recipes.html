      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>200g confectioners' sugar (close to 2 cups)</li>
        <li>100g almond flour (close to 1 cup)</li>
        <li>120g room temperature egg whites (around 3 large egg whites)</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>40g sifted granulated sugar or caster sugar (3 Tablespoons)</li>
        <li>flavoring or color</li>
        <li>your desired filling</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the confectioners' sugar and almond flour in a food processor
          or blender and pulse or blend for 30 seconds until thoroughly combined and fine in texture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a completely dry and grease-free bowl, beat the egg whites and
          salt together on medium speed for 1 minute. Switch to high speed and beat *just* until stiff peaks form,
          about 3 minutes. Do NOT overbeat. Using a metal spoon or rubber spatula, gently fold in the sifted granulated sugar,
          1 Tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>On low speed, beat in any flavor or color2 at this point. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Using a metal spoon or rubber spatula, fold in the confectioners' sugar/almond
        flour mixture until combined. Be very gentle and light-handed while doing so. Once completely
        combined, the mixture will be smooth, sticky, and glossy.</li>

        <li>Let the batter sit uncovered at room temperature for 10-30 minutes. Meanwhile,
        fit your piping bag with the piping tip. Line 2-3 baking sheets with silicone baking mats
        (read explanation in this post about why these mats are preferred).</li>

        <li>Fill the piping bag with the batter and pipe evenly sized rounds onto the baking sheets--
        make sure you are holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet. While piping,
        the batter will slightly spread out, so keep that in mind. You want around 2-inch circles.
        Gently tap the bottom of the baking sheets on your counter to rid any large air bubbles.
        You can lightly sprinkle a few sprinkles, a dash of cinnamon, or any edible decorations onto
        the wet round shells at this point.</li>
        <li>Let the piped rounds sit for at least 45 minutes and up to 1 hour. This is crucial to
        making macarons! The air will will help the rounds set and form a dry shell. They should
        not be sticky going into the oven.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Bake the macarons for 10 minutes, one baking sheet at a time.
        Rotate the pan at the 5 minute mark. The tops should be crisp and the macarons should have formed
        their signature crinkly "feet." Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet before filling.</li>
        <li>Fill and sandwich two shells together to form an iconic French macaron cookie! Leftover
        macarons keep well covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
